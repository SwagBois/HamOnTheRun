All levels include textures and is a complete game from beginning to end, allowing it to be a 3D Game Feel game.

Objectives are clearly stated on Start menu, as well as controls for the player to use. Levels get progressively harder and allow user to have more control. For example, the ability to switch between characters.

All scenes have a pig which is controlled by the player with engaging animations that react to the player's inputs. The controls are intuitive because it uses keyboard arrows for movement, similar to many other computer video games.

Levels 1 & 3 incorporate state-machine based Artificial Intelligence. This AI is included in the robot detecting the pig. The interactions are critical to getting to the final checkpoint.

Level 3 utilizes rigid body physics simulation with interactive objects (crates).

Level 3 has environment that acknowledges the player. This is apparent with the fans that push the player around.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known bugs: 
Phase through floor in the beginning of Level 3.
The crate on the big switch button in Level 3 sometimes doesn't trigger the switch. Player needs to move it around a little.
The pig sometimes phases through the ramps in Level 3.
